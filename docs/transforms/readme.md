# Transforms

This collection of methods describe `scale`, `translate`, `skew`, `rotate`, and offset a large
portion of calculations onto the GPU in a very CPU friendly way. Since transforms are stackable,
they result in push and pop operations that modify the state of the canvas using the `setTransform`
function appropriately.
